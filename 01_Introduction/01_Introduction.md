# Books Store APP ðŸ“š

We will learn how to build a book store app, and communicate with a backend to hold our data.

We will learn how to use:

- New Packages
- HTTP Request and Dio Client
- Forms and forms validation
- Using the device camera or picking an image from the gallery

Download the starter project from GitHub, then open the project by using the VS Code, and get the packages.
